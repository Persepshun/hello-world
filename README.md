# hello-world
AI innovation internship


Hello,

My name is Daniel Speedone.

I am a student at BMCC who is currently attending an AI innovation challenge.  This is not my first repository but I am making this as a part of the assignment.  I am 34 and am excited to graduate in the fall.  I am also eager to see what is going on with this internship and seeing how this goes.

Thanks for reading!

Sincerely,
Daniel S.
